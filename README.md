database
--------
Mongodb was used as a database. Throughout the project, I used local mongodb even in the code example('backend/app.js').
If you want to use mongodb from the cloud, the sample is provided in '.env.example'.

backend

NodeJs and expressJs was used as a server side programming language, and also some additional packages.
